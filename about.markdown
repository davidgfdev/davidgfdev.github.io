Hi, I'm David Guerrero!

I'm always working on a project, be it a video game, an app or just researching some technology. I always have something on the works, so I keep updating my GitHub and Itch.io with new games and projects. I really like being able to create my own video games and embrace the whole process that that entails, from concept to development and publication.

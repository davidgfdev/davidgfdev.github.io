# Portfolio
A site where I upload the projects I'm working on!

Each project starts with a very clear premise, some defined objectives and from there I just let myself explore and have fun while I learn.

# 2D Platformer

## Unity. C#.

2D level-based side scroller platformer in Unity.

![x4F3_J](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85587392/218338065-fda72aec-9f4b-4155-8d7f-6a6d6cdf6430.png)


### Project Overview

This is a 2D platformer where player controls an explorer cat who wants to climb a mountain. 

There are 13 levels with different challenges, mechanics and themathics. (Forest, Cave, Mountain Peak)

The project had one main goal: to experiment with all my knowledge.

Of course, I had to set some constraints:

- Time is unlimited, but the scope of the project must be small.
- Duration of the game must be less than 1 hour.
- I can experiment with all genres I want, but it MUST be a 2D side-scroller.

The game started as a survival game where player could wander a level and gather resources to create items.

The crafting system was 100% complete, but level design and player objectives where a problemathic that was elevating the scope of the project, so I needed to change the project vision.

I switched to a metroidvania type of platformer, and created the whole map, playable from start to end. Metroidvania presented a problem: I wasn't ready to create an artstyle that could make navigation easy.

The final vision for the project was a level-based arcade platformer.

My favourite project till now, I had lots of fun making it.

* I programmed and designed everything except the music and the sounds.

2021 - It was a game created for my research project.

### Project Overview

This project was created as our collaborative end of year project.

We were 4 teams. Three teams of 3 developers, each one for a minigame, and one team of 4 developers for the main game.

I was involved in the main game team, as the principal programmer and responsible for the whole tech part of the game.

My roles:

- Gameplay Code for the player, interactions and UI.
- Behaviour Tree of the enemy and NavMesh.
- I was also involved in the level design, along with my teammates
- At the last paces of the development, I assisted the tech part of the other teams and merged their minigames with the main game.

This is a school project with the only objective of evaluating our individual skills and teamwork, it may not be the perfect game, but the learning process and the fun of pulling something together was an unforgettable experience. I loved every single moment of working in this project and I'm grateful I did it with my classmates.

# 2D Space Shooter (Battallion Nemesis)

## Unity. C#.

2D Space Shooter game I created in Unity.

![ac6e252514d0ac6b1368da3149076fb3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85587392/218335100-7d8bbe1a-6c7a-47f8-8beb-5a9923d3d28c.png)

### Project Overview

This is a space shooter that can be completed in 5 minutes. Premise was to make a fast-paced game with Unity with the following objectives:

- 5 types of different enemies, each one with a different behaviour.
- An upgrade system where the player can upgrade speed, damage and range.
- A functional, stylized UI representative of the gameplay state.

* The game features a wave spawning system for the enemies, 4 enemy archetypes with their respective code, an upgrade system and a final boss.

* I programmed and designed everything except the music and the sounds.

2018 - It was a game created for my research project.

# 3D Shooter

## Unity. C#.

(2019) 3D Shooter I made with Unity back in 2019 inspired by Wolfenstein3D.

![386582-crop0_670_3751_2059-ll-cndx3c22-v4 (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85587392/218335040-dcf93f8d-4d7a-4423-b3b8-9078efe49704.jpg)

### Project Overview

Is a Unity shooter where you explore a Space Station filled with enemies. Objectives are simple, find the generators and disable them, kill enemies and go to the next level.

Premise of the project was to create a simple 3D experience with the following objectives:

- An hybrid system with hit-scan for the player, and projectiles for the enemies. The player can shoot while moving and doding bullets, makes combat more dynamic.
- Different types of enemies with animations and 3D behaviours. (3 enemy types: simple soldier, a heavy soldier and a fast melee soldier)
- My first take on some level design. (4 playable levels.)
- At least 2 different weapon types. (4 different weapons including the knife).

* This project is a little bit old. But I'm still very happy about the animations and the shooting style of the game.

* I programmed and designed everything except the music and the sounds.

2019 - It was a personal project.

# 2D Space Shooter (Battallion Nemesis)

2D Space Shooter game I created in Unity.

This is a space shooter that can be completed in 5 minutes. Premise was to make a fast-paced game with Unity with the following objectives:

- 5 types of different enemies, each one with a different behaviour.
- An upgrade system where the player can upgrade speed, damage and range.
- A functional, stylized UI representative of the gameplay state.

* The game features a wave spawning system for the enemies, 4 enemy archetypes with their respective code, an upgrade system and a final boss.

* I programmed and designed everything except the music and the sounds.

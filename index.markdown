# Portfolio
A site where I upload the projects I'm working on!

Each project starts with a very clear premise, some defined objectives and from there I just let myself explore and have fun while I learn.

# 2D Space Shooter (Battallion Nemesis)

2D Space Shooter game I created in Unity.

## Project Overview

This is a space shooter that can be completed in 5 minutes. Premise was to make a fast-paced game with Unity with the following objectives:

- 5 types of different enemies, each one with a different behaviour.
- An upgrade system where the player can upgrade speed, damage and range.
- A functional, stylized UI representative of the gameplay state.

* The game features a wave spawning system for the enemies, 4 enemy archetypes with their respective code, an upgrade system and a final boss.

* I programmed and designed everything except the music and the sounds.

# 3D Shooter

(2019) 3D Shooter I made with Unity back in 2019 inspired by Wolfenstein3D.

## Project Overview

Is a Unity shooter where you explore a Space Station filled with enemies. Objectives are simple, find the generators and disable them, kill enemies and go to the next level.

Premise of the project was to create a simple 3D experience with the following objectives:

- An hybrid system with hit-scan for the player, and projectiles for the enemies. The player can shoot while moving and doding bullets, makes combat more dynamic.
- Different types of enemies with animations and 3D behaviours. (3 enemy types: simple soldier, a heavy soldier and a fast melee soldier)
- My first take on some level design. (4 playable levels.)
- At least 2 different weapon types. (4 different weapons including the knife).

* This project is a little bit old. But I'm still very happy about the animations and the shooting style of the game.

* I programmed and designed everything except the music and the sounds.
